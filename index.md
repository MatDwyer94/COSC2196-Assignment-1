## Personal Information

**Name** Mathew Dwyer

**Student Number** S3807459

**Email Address** S3807459@student.rmit.edu.au

**Background Information**

My name is Mathew Dwyer. I am a 26 year old, white, straight male. While I was originally raised as Christian, I now consider myself non-religious. I have previously studied 3 semesters of a bachelor of communications, and done part of a tafe course regarding video game design. I speak English and am currently trying to learn German. One of my favourite past times is playing with electronics. Currently that is revolved around 3D printers and learning CAD and 3D modelling. It is extremely helpful to me as I like to print miniatures and terrain for my DnD games.



## Interest In IT

My interest in IT covers pretty much anything electronic. From tiny little gadgets all the way up to giant machines. Ever since I was a kid, I have always tried to get my hands on anything I can, take it apart and try to work out how it works, and try and put it back together. As I got older, that progressed on to repairing anything I broke, and building my own. That includes learning to program it. I don't have any official experience in IT, but I have helped build a website for a volunteer organisation and I am one of the staff who built and maintain the website at my current job.

I chose to attend RMIT as I finally decided to start pursuing my interest in IT at a professional level, however, I currently work full time and am unable to attend university in person. I saw that RMIT had an online bachelor of IT and it seemed to be a very good program, so I decided to attend. So far it has been a decent experience.

During my studies, I am hoping to learn how to design my own full programs and get a deeper understanding on how IT systems affect our daily lives and interact with us and each other, as well as how it all generally works.

###Description of Position

An engineer that helps create and implement automation systems using various different technologies. I have always loved the idea of automation and making technology do the work for you so this would be an incredibly interesting job.

###Skills and Qualifications required

Knowledge in an extremely wide variety of progamming and coding languages would be essential as well as how they interact with different frameworks. Even how the frameworks work together. It would also be extremely helpful to know how electronics work to be able to more efficiently create code for it. Qualifications in IT and possibly electrical engineering would be necessary/advantageous to be successful at a job like this.

###Current Skills and Qualifications

I currently have basic programming skills and electronics knowledge. But still not on the level needed for a job of this level.

###Plan to attain Skills and Qualifications

Study a bachelor of IT with a focus on programming, internet and connected technologies, and cybersecurity. I could possibly pursue post graduate studies in electrical engineering to help solidify knowledge in more related areas.
