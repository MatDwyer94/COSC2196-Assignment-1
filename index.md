**Background Information**

My name is Mathew Dwyer. I am a 26 year old, white, straight male. While I was originally raised as Christian, I now consider myself non-religious. I have previously studied 3 semesters of a bachelor of communications, and done part of a tafe course regarding video game design. I speak English and am currently trying to learn German. One of my favourite past times is playing with electronics. Currently that is revolved around 3D printers and learning CAD and 3D modelling. It is extremely helpful to me as I like to print miniatures and terrain for my DnD games.
